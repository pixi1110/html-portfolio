<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Džemilah Šestić and I come from Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  I am an university student at Faculty of Law in my hometown. Recently I have fallen
  in love with coding and, while simultaneously finishing my studies, I want to continue
  working on improving my programming skills.
